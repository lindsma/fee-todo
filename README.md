## Week 6 

#### Objective:
Create a TODO list application that operates according the specifications below. 

* Create a TODO item when the user submits the new TODO form 
* Clicking on a todo item's text allows the user to edit the item inline
* Hovering over a todo shows the red "X", and clicking on that "X" deletes the item
* The incomplete item count should always be displayed in the bottom left corner
* Clicking on "Active" at the bottom nav results in only showing incomplete items
* Clicking on "Completed" at the bottom results in only showing complete items
* Clicking on "All" at the bottom results in showing all items, regardless of status
* Clicking on the circle to the left of an item toggles whether it is complete or not
* Clicking "Clear completed" removes any todo item that is marked complete
